<!-- About The Project -->
## üöÄ About The Project

This project aims to provide a complete and clear documentation of test cases, automation, and API tests in one place. This will allow those responsible to have easy access to the necessary information.

The documentation of test cases will be written in detail, covering all the test scenarios that have been identified for the system. Each test case will have information about the test objective, prerequisites, steps to be followed, and the expected outcome.

The automation of test cases will be implemented according to the documented test cases from exploratory tests on the provided system.

API tests will be documented and automated using Postman, verifying the integration of different parts of the system and confirming whether all APIs are functioning as expected.

Additionally, this project will provide examples of how to run tests, including information on how to set up the test environment and how to execute test automation.

All information will be available in this Git repository.
